## Functions

A **function** $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ exactly one element $y$ in a set $E$. The set $D$ is called the **domain** of the function, and the set $E$ is called the **codomain** of the function. The notation $f(x)=y$ indicates that $y$ is the image of $x$ under the function $f$. The set of all images of elements in the domain is called the **range** of the function.
The following is the most common representation of a function:

\\[
f: X \to Y : x \mapsto f(x)
\\]
