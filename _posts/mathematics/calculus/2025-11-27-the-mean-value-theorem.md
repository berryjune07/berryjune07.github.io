## Rolle's Theorem

**Rolle's Theorem** is a Lemma that serves as a foundation for the Mean Value Theorem.
> Let $f$ be a continuous function on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$.
If $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists at least one point $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f^\prime(c) = 0$.
