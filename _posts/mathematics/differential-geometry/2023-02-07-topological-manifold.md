## Topological manifold
A **topological manifold** is a _second countable Hausdorff space_ that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space.
* $X$ is second countable Hausdorff space
* $ \forall x\in X,\; \exist N\in\mathcal{N}_x \;\text{s.t.}$ $N$ and $\R^n$ are homeomorphic

If then, $X$ is an **$n$-dimensional topological manifold**.
