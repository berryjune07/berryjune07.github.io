## Introduction

The convex hull of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains the shape.
It can be visualized as the shape formed by stretching a rubber band around the outermost points of the shape.
The convex hull is a fundamental concept in computational geometry and has applications in various fields such as computer graphics, pattern recognition, and geographic information systems.
Here, we will explore the **convex hull algorithm**, which is used to compute the convex hull of a set of finite points in the plane.
