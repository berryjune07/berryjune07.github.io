## Momentum space

We've seen that the wavefunction in position space is given by as follows, where $\ket{\alpha}$ is an arbitrary state vector.

\\[ \hat{\b{x}}\ket{\b{x}\rq} = \b{x}\rq\ket{\b{x}\rq} \\]
\\[ \psi_\alpha(\b{x}) = \brkt{\b{x}}{\alpha} \\]

Similarly, we can describe the wavefunction in momentum space, too.

\\[ \hat{\b{p}}\ket{\b{p}\rq} = \b{p}\rq\ket{\b{p}\rq} \\]
\\[ \phi_\alpha(\b{p}) = \brkt{\b{p}}{\alpha} \\]

Let's discuss eigenstate and eigenvalue of the momentum operator at 1-dimensional position space.
We cet get such differential equation:

\\[ p\brkt{x}{p} = -i\hbar\pdv{}{x} \\]
