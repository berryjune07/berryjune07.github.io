## Introduction

The free surface of a liquid in equilibrium in a gravitational field is horizontal.
If, under the action of external perturbation, the surface is displaced from its equilibrium position, and this motion will be propagated as waves on the surface of the liquid.
**Gravity waves** are waves that occur on the surface of a fluid, such as water, where the restoring force is gravity.
These waves are commonly observed in oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water.
Gravity waves appear mainly on the surface of liquids; they affect the interior also but to a much smaller extent.
