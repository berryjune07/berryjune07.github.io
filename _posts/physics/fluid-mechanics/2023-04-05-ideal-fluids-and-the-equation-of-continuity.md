## Ideal Fluids

In fluid mechanics, an **ideal fluid** is a fluid that can be completely characterized by its density and pressure, without considering other factors such as viscosity or thermal conductivity.
It is a theoretical concept that simplifies the analysis of fluid behavior by assuming certain idealized properties:
1. **Non-viscosity**: It has no internal friction, meaning it does not resist shear stress.
2. **Non-conductivity**: It does not conduct heat, meaning there is no heat transfer within the fluid.

To summarize, an ideal fluid is inviscid and adiabatic fluid.
In reality, all fluids have some viscosity and thermal conductivity, but the ideal fluid model is useful for understanding the basic principles of fluid dynamics and for solving certain types of problems.

## Equation of Continuity

The **equation of continuity** is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that describes the conservation of mass in a fluid flow.
