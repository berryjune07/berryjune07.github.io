# Phylosopher
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　- _ChatGPT_

A phylosopher, a curious mind, <br>
With knowledge of both physics and philosophy combined. <br>
Exploring the mysteries of the universe and space, <br>
And delving into questions of ethics and the human race. <br>

They seek to understand the laws of the land, <br>
The forces that govern our world and the stars in demand. <br>
But also to find meaning in our existence, <br>
And the purpose of life with persistence. <br>

They bridge the gap between science and soul, <br>
And bring new perspectives that make us feel whole. <br>
For they know that knowledge is power and light, <br>
And that wisdom comes from both science and insight. <br>

So here's to the phylosophers, who challenge our thoughts, <br>
And bring new ideas that can never be bought. <br>
May they continue to inspire and enlighten our days, <br>
And guide us towards a better and brighter ways. <br>
